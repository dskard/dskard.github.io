## About the code

The projects highlighted on these pages are primarily focused around work I've done providing interfaces for users building science based simulation and analysis tools and deploying them on the internet. Many of the projects are open source. Links are provided for project web pages and package sources on the [Software](software.html) page. The [Dissemination](dissemination.html) page highlights workshops I've led, conference talks I've given, and papers I've contributed to. Check out the [github](https://github.com/codedsk) for other stuff I'm playing around with.

## About the dsk

There are three things you should know about me:

1. I like to ask questions and solve problems, using software when possible.
2. I love to learn.
3. I enjoy sharing knowledge with others.
